This project is to create an extension to expose data and function to MCP client.

It will create an extension and a MCP server that talk to the extension.
The MCP server will be implemented in Python with FastMCP.
It is Websocket between the extension and the MCP server.

# Codex Integration

## FM_ROOT Environment Variable
The `FM_ROOT` environment variable is set to the project root directory. This enables Codex to reference project paths consistently when running bash commands.

**IMPORTANT: Always use `$FM_ROOT` in bash commands to refer to project files and paths - this is much less error-prone than relative paths.**

Examples of proper usage:
```bash
# Read project files
cat $FM_ROOT/README.md
ls $FM_ROOT/tests/

# Run tests with proper paths
PYTHONPATH=$FM_ROOT/tests $FM_ROOT/venv/bin/python -m pytest $FM_ROOT/tests/test_example.py

# Edit files with absolute paths
vim $FM_ROOT/server/server.py

# Find files in project
find $FM_ROOT -name "*.py" -type f
```

Benefits of using `$FM_ROOT`:
- ✅ **Error-free paths** - No ambiguity about working directory
- ✅ **Consistent execution** - Commands work from any directory
- ✅ **Clear intent** - Obviously references project files
- ✅ **Reliable automation** - No path resolution issues

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
NEVER create git commits unless explicitly requested by the User.
NEVER add Codex attribution or "Generated with Codex" footer in git commit messages.

# Testing Guidelines
ALWAYS use example.org for test URLs instead of httpbin.org or any other service.
- example.org is the official reserved domain for testing and documentation
- Use paths like https://example.org/path1, https://example.org/test, etc.
- NEVER use httpbin.org, httpbin.com, or similar external testing services
- This ensures tests are reliable and don't depend on external services

## Firefox Test Setup
ALWAYS use the consolidated method `setup_and_start_firefox()` for Firefox test setup:
- USE: `firefox.setup_and_start_firefox(headless=True)`
- Extension path is automatically determined internally using `_get_extension_xpi_path()`
- The old individual methods (`create_test_profile()`, `install_extension()`, `start_firefox()`) have been removed
- This ensures consistent setup, error handling, and reduces code duplication across tests
- Internal methods (`_create_test_profile()`, `_get_extension_xpi_path()`, etc.) are implementation details and should not be called directly

## Multi-Profile Connections
FoxMCP supports multiple simultaneous Firefox extension WebSocket connections. The server keeps a registry of connected extensions, exposes `connections_list` and `connections_select`, and preserves `extension_connection` as a backward-compatible alias for the currently selected/default connection. Existing tools route to the active connection unless a lower-level request includes `connection_id`, `connectionId`, or `profile` in `data`.

Firefox WebExtensions do not expose the actual Firefox profile path/name. The extension sends a best-effort `connection.hello` message with optional labels from `browser.storage.local` or `browser.storage.sync` (`profileName`, `connectionName`, or `foxmcpProfileName`), plus extension/platform metadata. If labels are absent, select sessions by connection ID.

For local multi-profile verification on standard Firefox builds, prefer `npx --yes web-ext run --source-dir $FM_ROOT/extension --firefox /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox --firefox-profile "<profile dir>" --no-reload --no-input --start-url about:blank --args=-no-remote`. A copied unsigned XPI may appear installed in a normal app profile without running its background script until loaded through the development workflow or signed.

# Debugging Configuration

## ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING_TO_SERVER Setting

Controls whether the Firefox extension sends debug messages to the server. Located in `extension/background.js` line ~97.

```javascript
const ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING_TO_SERVER = false;  // Set to true for debugging
```

**Usage:**
- Enable (`true`) for debugging extension connection issues or test failures
- Disable (`false`) for production and before committing
- After changing, run `make clean && make package` and clear profile cache: `rm -rf dist/profile-cache/*`

**IMPORTANT: Always set back to `false` before committing.**
